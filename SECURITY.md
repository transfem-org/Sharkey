# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in Sharkey, please report it by sending an
email to [admin@transfem.org](mailto:admin@transfem.org).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make Sharke safe for everyone.
